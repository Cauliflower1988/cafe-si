## Instructions for running the CafeDemo sample

The example comes with two identical configurations. One is ANNOTATION-based another is XML-based

To run this sample simply execute the CafeDemoApp class in the **org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.xml** package.

See the configuration files in the **META-INF/spring/integration** path.

See the Splitter in action, reading multiple orders from a JMS broker, converting them from XML to Java orders and processing them.

Use ./src/test/resources/orders/orders.xml and mqconsole to send a request to the activemq broker.
