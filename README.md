## Instructions for running the CafeDemo sample

The example comes with two identical configurations. One is ANNOTATION-based another is XML-based

To run this sample simply execute the CafeDemoApp class in the **org.springframework.integration.samples.cafe.xml** package.

See the configuration files in the **META-INF/spring/integration** path.

Created a new item type that can be ordered - food.
